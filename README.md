#A web application that provides an application related management plans and tools that are affordable, easy to access and complete to increase effectiveness and efficiency in implementing project management process.
# Getting Started
The application should run on any of the commonly used web browsers, but Google Chrome is highly recommended. Upon landing on the main page, the top nav bar allows user to navigate, a click on subscription pages takes the user to subscription page which provides information regarding subscription plans and the cost associated, a click on LinkedIn will connect the user to owner, and a click on signup will allow the user to become a member. 
#Below flowchart-style interface depicts the entire project management lifecycle. In each box, a component of the lifecycle is represented and a click will provide information regarding that particular part of the process and links to templates for the plans and tools related to that portion of the project management process, and allow user to download template for that life cycle according to user’s subscription.
#The footer of the page offers information regarding the Projematic, sliding testimonials from clients and contact information, in that order.
